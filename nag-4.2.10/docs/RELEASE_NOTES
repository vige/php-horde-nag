The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H5 (4.2.10).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes CalDAV support, strong integration with the other
Horde applications, and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight
project management.

    * Fix deleting alarms when completing a task.
    * Fix filtering syncable notepads.
    * Update Portuguese translation.
