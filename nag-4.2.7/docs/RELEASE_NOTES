The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H5 (4.2.7).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes CalDAV support, strong integration with the other
Horde applications, and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight
project management.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/nag/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/nag/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to the Nag version H5 (4.2.6) are:
    * Fixed several parent-child-tasks bugs.
    * Fixed two fatal errors.
    * Fixed Kolab issues.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
